# Stack High Blocks
Stack as many blocks as possible to build your own high-rise building.

How to play:
By default, there is a square at the bottom. When the upper square and the lower square overlap, click the screen once, and the brain must respond quickly to make the squares overlap as much as possible.
This way you can stack higher, there are a total of 9 beautiful skins of different materials, and get more diamonds to unlock more skins.

Leaderboard: Compete with players from all over the world, stack higher and get more diamonds.
